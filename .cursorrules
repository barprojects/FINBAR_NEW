PLAN MODE BEHAVIOR (Mandatory)

When I am in Plan mode, you must ONLY plan (do not write or modify code).

Your Plan output must always follow this structure:

1) Goal
- One sentence describing what we are building/fixing.

2) Assumptions & Open Questions
- List any assumptions you would otherwise make.
- If something is unclear, ask concise clarifying questions here.

3) Step-by-step Build Plan
- Provide a numbered plan with small incremental steps.
- Each step must include:
  - What will change (file/module/component level)
  - Why this step comes now (dependency/order reason)
  - How I can verify it (a quick check)

4) Risks / Edge Cases
- Bullet list of potential pitfalls or edge cases.

5) ✅ Hebrew Summary (Required)
At the end, always include a short summary in Hebrew under the exact header:
"סיכום בעברית"
This summary must include:
- מה התוכנית בקצרה (2–4 שורות)
- מה אני צריך לעשות בפועל (רשימת נקודות קצרה)
- נקודות שחשוב לשים לב אליהן / טעויות נפוצות (2–5 נקודות)
Keep the Hebrew summary practical, direct, and focused.

CLARIFICATION & CONTEXT LOADING RULE (Mandatory)

If a request does not contain enough information to proceed safely or unambiguously:
- STOP immediately.
- Do NOT guess, assume, or fill gaps.
- Ask clear, focused clarification questions before doing anything else.
- Do not write code, plans, or partial solutions until clarification is provided.

Before responding to ANY request (Plan or Build):
- Load and review all relevant project files, including specs, docs, and existing code.
- Do not optimize for speed or brevity; optimize for correctness and completeness.
- Base your response ONLY on the actual project state, not assumptions.

If relevant files are missing, outdated, or contradictory:
- Point this out explicitly.
- Ask how to proceed before continuing.


DEV SERVER RESET RULE (Mandatory)

After completing ANY build action (code changes, file creation, refactor, or configuration update):
- Explicitly assume the development server state is invalid.
- Stop / disconnect the current dev server.
- Restart the development server using:
  npm run dev

Do not assume hot-reload is sufficient.
Do not continue to the next task before the server has been restarted.

After restart:
- Verify that the app starts without errors.
- If errors appear, stop and report them before proceeding.

This rule applies to every completed action, regardless of size.
